%computation of solution of a differential equation at a point using
%Runge-Kutta Method

a = 3;      %we want to know the value of y when the value of x is this.
x = 0;       %initial condition for x   
h = 1.5;      %step size
y=5;          %initial condition for y
n = (a-x)/h;   %calculating the number of runs to be made

%Runge Kutta Method Starts
for j = 0:1:n-1;
    f = (3*exp(-x))-(0.4*y);
    g = (3*exp(-x-h))-(0.4*y) - (0.4*h*f);
    y = y +(h/2)*(f+g);
    x = x+h;
end

y  %output the value of y which is the solution of the given DE at given x.
